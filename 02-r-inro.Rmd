# Introduction to R language

Since this book includes a lot of R code examples, this chapter will describe some basics for those, who is not familiar with R. For purposes of understanding R code in this book you don't need any deep knowledge of R. In case you want to learn more, there are a lot of good books on it. I will list only few of them:

* 
* 

## Instalation
### R instalation
To download R, go to [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/). Don't try to pick a mirror that's close to you, instead it is better to use the cloud mirror, https://cloud.r-project.org.

### RStudio
RStudio is an integrated development environment, or IDE, for R programming. There are two possibilities:

* type R code in the R console pane, and press enter to run it;
* type R code in the Code editor pane, and press Control/Command + Enter to run selected part. It is easier to correct and it is possible to save the result as a script.

```{r rstudio, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="RStudio layout"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/02-rstudio.png", dpi = 100)
```

When you first launch RStudio it is more likely, that you won't see the Code Editor pane. It is possible to decrease R Console pane on icons in the pane's right upper corner.

Everything from this book will be availible without RStudio instalation. There are a lot of possibilities to work with R not using RStudio such as R console, command line, Jupyter Notebook, some plugins for working in Sublime, Vim, Emacs, Atom, Notepad++ and other programming text editors.

### RStuio cloud
It is also possible not to install anything on your own PC, using [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/), a web-based interface for Rstudio and R. In RStudio Cloud it is also possible to share your R projects and collaborate with a select group in a private space. RStudio Cloud is currently free to use, but soon there will be free and paid options.

## Base elements, variables, vectors, dataframe
### Base elements
```{r}
7
-5.7
"bonjour"
"bon mot"
TRUE
FALSE
```
### Variables
```{r}
my_var <- 7
my_var
my_var+7
my_var
my_var <- my_var + 7
```

### Vectors
```{r}
5:9
11:4
numbers <- c(7, 9.9, 24)
multiple_strings <- c("the", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog")
one_string <- c("the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog")
true_false <- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)
length(numbers)
length(multiple_strings)
length(one_string)
```

### Dataframes
```{r}
my_df <- data.frame(latin = c("a", "b", "c"),
                    cyrillic = c("а", "б", "в"),
                    greek = c("α", "β", "γ"),
                    numbers = c(1:3),
                    is.vowel = c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE),
                    stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
my_df
nrow(my_df)
ncol(my_df)
```

### Indexing
```{r}
numbers[3]
multiple_strings[9]
my_df[2, 3]
my_df[2,]
my_df[,3]
my_df$is.vowel
my_df$is.vowel[2]
```

## Reading files
We can read to R a dataset about Numeral Classifiers from [AUTOTYP database](https://github.com/autotyp/autotyp-data).
```{r}
new_df <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/autotyp/autotyp-data/master/data/Numeral_classifiers.csv")
head(new_df)
tail(new_df)
```

It could be also a file on your computer, just provide a whole path to the file. Windows users need to change backslashes `\` to slashes `/`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
new_df_2 <- read.csv("/home/agricolamz/my_file.csv")
```

## Writing files from R
```{r, eval = FALSE}
write.csv(new_df_2, "/home/agricolamz/my_new_file.csv",
          row.names = FALSE)
```

## Missing data
In R, missing values are represented by the symbol `NA` (not available).

```{r}
is.na(new_df$NumClass.Presence)
sum(is.na(new_df$NumClass.Presence))
sum(is.na(new_df))
```

## How to get help in R
```{r, eval = FALSE}
?nchar
```

## Packages
There are a lot of R packages for solving a lot of different problems. There are two way for install them (you need an internet connection):

* packages on CRAN are checked in multiple ways and should be stable

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("lingtypology")
```

* packages on GitHub are NOT checked and could contain anything, but it is the place where all package developers keep the last vertion of they work.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ropensci/lingtypology")
```

* or package file
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("lingtypology",
                 destdir = "/path/to/your/package")
```

After the package is installed you need to load the package using the following command:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library("lingtypology")
```

There is a nice picture from [Phillips N. D. (2017) YaRrr! The Pirate’s Guide to R](https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/):

```{r lamp, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Lamp metaphore"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/02-package.png", dpi = 100)
```
